This exercise serve as an introduction to coding best practice for new/junior developer. From my undestanding, some of the HTML tags serve the same purpose to the design of the page.  The difference lie on the meaning that each tags represent.  Implementing semantic markup in your code will help add proper structure to the code that will be easier for machine to read your content and will expand the accessiblity of your webpage.
