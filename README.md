# Homework 1: HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## INTRODUCTION

This is the first assignment from the section "Introduction to Web Developement, HTML, CSS, and Git."  This is an individual homework with a pre-written HTML and CSS code.  The goal of this activity is to refactor the given code and use semantic markup in the HTML and CSS design.

## PURPOSE

This exercise serves as an introduction to coding best practice for new/junior developer. From my undestanding, some of the HTML tags serve the same purpose to the function of the page.  Taking a deper dive in it, the difference lie on the meaning that each tags represent.  Implementing semantic markup in your code will help add proper structure to the code and allow meaningfull syntax for any machine reader. This will expand the accessiblity of your webpage.

## CHALLENGES

My initial chalenge was my limited familiarity of the Html tags. What help me tremendously is the information found on MDN web docs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML.  I used information in the "HTML elements reference" section as my guide in completing this asignment.  

## CHANGES

My first approach in this assignment is to apply proper semantic tags to the structure on the HTML. I applied semantic tags such as **header, main, section, aside, footer**, inplace of the general **div** tags and then moved on to the details such as adding a description to all of the images using the alt attribute and cleaning improper code.  To eliminate redundancy, I created a single class that consolidate repeated class functions. For example, a new class <u>main-content</u> is to replace class search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management and social-media-marketing, then a new class <u>side-content</u> is to replace class benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost. 
Lastly, I re-organized the sequence of the HTML and CSS code and updated footer to the current year.
